Enhancing Crop Health through Hyperspectral Soil Parameters Prediction and Fertilizer Recommendation
üåæ Project Overview
This project aims to revolutionize traditional soil testing and fertilizer recommendation methods by leveraging hyperspectral imaging and machine learning. By capturing detailed spectral data from soil samples, the system predicts essential soil parameters and offers tailored fertilizer recommendations, promoting sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.

üéØ Objectives
Predict vital soil parameters (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, Moisture) using hyperspectral data.

Recommend optimal fertilizers based on soil health and crop requirements.

Improve crop yield and reduce environmental degradation caused by fertilizer overuse.

üß™ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Source: Hyperspectral images and corresponding soil health reports

Visualization Tools: Spectral reflectance graphs, heatmaps, accuracy comparison plots

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Collection
Soil samples were collected from various regions and scanned using hyperspectral imaging.

Corresponding chemical parameters were measured through lab tests for validation.

2. Preprocessing
Noise removal and reflectance calibration of hyperspectral data.

Conversion to spectral signatures and dimension reduction techniques like PCA.

3. Model Building
Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) were trained on the processed data to predict individual soil parameters.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

4. Fertilizer Recommendation System
Based on predicted parameters, fertilizer types and quantities were recommended using a rule-based decision engine integrated with agronomic knowledge.

üìà Results
Prediction Accuracy:

Nitrogen: 95.23%

Phosphorus: 94.89%

Potassium: 93.64%

pH: 92.54%

Moisture: 91.77%

Best Performing Model: Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy across all parameters.

The fertilizer recommendation engine showed a 20-25% improvement in resource efficiency and crop compatibility.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates that hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning is a viable and efficient alternative to conventional soil testing. It enables real-time, non-destructive, and region-specific insights for sustainable agriculture. By offering precise fertilizer recommendations, it not only boosts crop health but also curbs environmental harm.
